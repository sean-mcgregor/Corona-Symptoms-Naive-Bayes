# Corona-Symptoms-Naive-Bayes
A machine learning project to predict if a person has CoronaVirus based on the symptoms they input. Written in Java.

The user chooses a CSV file containing symptoms that different patients have had and whether or not each patient had or did not have the virus.

The program then processes the selected file using the FileProcessing.java and the associated methods. The data generated by FileProcessing.java is then used to create an instance of Dataset.java

The program then uses the Naive Bayes algorithm to calculate the % chance of a patient having Corona Virus based on symptoms the user inputs into the GUI.
